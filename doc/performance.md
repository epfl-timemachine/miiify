### Anecdotal notes on performance

Miiify does not use an enterprise-ready database for its storage requirements. Instead, it leverages Git for its persistent storage. Therefore, the performance of Miiify is governed by the ability to scale Git to potentially handle hundreds of thousands of files. There is a direct correlation between how annotations are stored in containers to how files are stored in directories. You can view each annotation as another file entry within a directory. Therefore, as the number of annotations increases within a container write performance degrades linearly. This will become noticeable when there are tens of thousands of annotations per container. However, read performance remains fairly constant. Git does a good job of handling data by carrying out its own garbage collection (gc) and packing data into binary files. Typically, gc will kick in when you use typical workflows. Data that is written to Miiify through the POST API does not trigger gc. This is generally not an issue if your deployment is behind a read-only proxy and updates come via a Git itself. Thus, continual writes (POSTs) will start to consume significant disk space and will require a manual call to gc to recover space. Overall performance is manageable for repositories that spread annotations across multiple containers and that try to avoid excessive amounts of annotations per containers or in visual terms are designed as a well-balanced tree.
